\section{About me}
\cvitem{}{A chemist by training, I have been fascinated by computers from an early age. After becoming interested in statistics, I pivoted my career to data science in 2017. Since then, I have worked in all stages of data analysis, from determining data requirements all the way to creating decisions from that data. I enjoy working in teams, pushing into git, cycling and bouldering.}

\section{Work experience}

\cventry{May 2020 - Nov 2023}{Decision Scientist}{Vinted, Vilnius}{}{}{
  Helped make decisions more data-based in full-stack development teams
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed, defined  and implemented various metrics for the team. OKRs at the top level, but also their decomposition into drivers. 
  \item Contributed to exposing our data to the rest of the company by developing data models, developing nightly jobs to calculcate them, and finally expose this data through \emph{Looker}.
  \item Organized and overlooked AB experiments on both internal and customer-facing features: proposed and defined measures and how to measure them, calculated sample sizes before the experiments and result statistical significance after. 
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Nov 2017 - May 2020}{Data analyst}{UAB Scorify, Vilnius}{}{}{
  A position that expanded as I spent more time in the company and got to know
  the infrastructure better.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Started with tasks in data extraction, such as imports from raw
    sources, some light web scraping, and automating these ingests into our
    databases.
  \item Moved on to building predictive models for projects, working mostly with \emph{Tensorflow} and \emph{xgboost} - respectively convolutional neural networks and random forests. 
  \item On the side, worked to revive and took on administrating one of our
    older servers, in which I set up and started promoting our internal Wiki
    page and Gitlab server.
  \item Developed a few internal webapps, using the amazing \emph{Shiny}
    framework, which we used to spread our data insights within the company.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2017-2018}{ETL/web scraping}{upwork.com, freelancing platform}{}{}{
  Freelanced on the Upwork platform
}

\cventry{Mar 2016 - Jan 2017}{Chemical analyst}{Smithers Rapra, Shrewsbury, UK
}{}{}{
  Prepped and carried out analyses of pharmaceutical polymers for leaching 
}

\section{Technical skills}

\cvitem{}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For data analysis and modelling, I absolutely love \emph{R} with 5+ years of experience. I have worked with \emph{Python} for a similar amount of time, just not as recently.
  \item 5+ years of SQL usage. For complex queries, I however prefer frameworks (\emph{ibis}, \emph{dbplyr})
  \item 3 years of \emph{Scala Spark}
  \item \emph{git}
  \item Technologies I don't consider my main strengths:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{guile scheme} and \emph{Emacs Lisp}
    \item \emph{Linux} and \emph{bash}
    \item \emph{C} 
    \item Basic knowledge of how Web works (\emph{HTML}, vanilla \emph{JS}, \emph{CSS}).
    \item \emph{Docker} containers and other \emph{virtualization} stack.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
